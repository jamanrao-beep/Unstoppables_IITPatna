## 🛑 The Invisible Crisis

Current environmental monitoring relies on massive, city-wide averages that mask the toxic reality of localized industrial and traffic zones. A sensor in a green park cannot warn a commuter about hazardous PM2.5 smog just 2km away.

**Pro Atmos Guard** eliminates these spatial blind spots. It is a decentralized, machine-learning-powered environmental command center that predicts pollution spikes before they happen and routes commuters safely around them.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🔮 Hyperlocal Predictive AI:** Utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost models to forecast localized PM2.5 and AQI spikes 12-24 hours in advance.
- **🗺️ Spatial Interpolation Engine:** Uses Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to accurately calculate air quality in unmapped spatial blind zones between physical IoT nodes.
- **🛡️ AI Safe Route Optimizer:** Integrates Leaflet GIS and OSRM to calculate driving/walking routes that avoid hazardous pollution pockets, reducing user PM2.5 inhalation by up to 22%.
- **🔥 Hyperscale Thermal Diagnostics:** Live tracking of Urban Heat Islands, specifically identifying extreme thermal anomalies caused by heavy industry and Hyperscale AI Server Farms ("The Thirsty Cloud").
- **📡 Custom IoT Hardware:** Integrated network of ESP32 microcontrollers and PMS5003 sensors feeding high-fidelity, real-time particulate data to the cloud.
- **💻 Immersive Glassmorphism UI:** Built with React and Framer Motion for a fluid, dark-mode, cyberpunk-inspired command terminal experience.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1.  **Data Acquisition Layer:** ESP32 + PMS5003 sensors collect real-time PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3, and CO levels.
2.  **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI securely ingests sensor streams and external meteorological data (Open-Meteo).
3.  **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Data is fed into our predictive engine, processing localized weather lag, traffic density, and historical AQI.
4.  **Client Application:** React frontend renders the interpolated data over interactive, multi-layered maps.

## 🌟 Our Vision

We cannot fix what we cannot see. By bridging the gap between invisible environmental data and actionable public safety, **Pro Atmos Guard** doesn't just monitor the future of our cities—it actively protects the people living in them. We are engineering a smarter, safer, and more breathable tomorrow.
